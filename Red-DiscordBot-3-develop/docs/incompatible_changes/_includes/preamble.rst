This page lists all functionalities that are currently deprecated, features that have been removed in past minor releases, and any other backward incompatible changes that are planned or have been removed in past minor releases. The objective is to give users a clear rationale why a certain change has been made, and what alternatives (if any) should be used instead.

These changes are sorted (in their respective sections) in a reverse chronological order.
